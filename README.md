# Sunrise Standup!!

Sunrise Standup is a status update application built as a demo for Build 2020. It allows users to submit a 15 second status update video clip and displays those clips in order by date in a feed. The user's location is recorded and displayed on an interactive map.

This application levarages several Azure resources...

1. **Azure Storage** for video uploads
1. **Cognitive Services** for video transcription
1. **Azure Maps** for the interactive map control
1. **Video Indexer** to pull thumbnails off of videos
1. **Logic Apps** to create a thumbnail when a video is uploaded

## Setup Azure Resources

1. Create a Video Index account and go to your profile page. [here](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/), Make note of your primary key.
